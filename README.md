## Make the Tests Pass

This warmup is designed to give you a taste of what it might look like complete
the `js-node-log-file-parsing` exercise using TDD (test driven development).

Tests help you break problems down into smaller, more digestible chunks and write cleaner code that is easier to reason about.

__REMEMBER:__ After code is written, it is _read_ over and over again by other developers and future you. It should read like a book!

Work through the tests one by one and make them pass.

__NOTE:__ Aim to write functions that are no longer than 8-10 lines, including curly braces and function names. To do this, you will need more functions than are tested in the provided test suite. That is ok! Write pure functions that can be used in other functions to make the code read better.

__Ask yourself:__

Does this function have one job? If not, is there code that can be extracted out into another, smaller function that _does_ have one job? 

When all tests are passing, uncomment the commented code in `log_parser.js` to
confirm the below expected results.
